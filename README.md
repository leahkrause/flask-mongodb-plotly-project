# project-3

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing mass shootings in the USA over the past several decades. The goal is to gain insights into the frequency, location, and other characteristics of these events, as well as to explore potential correlations with various social and political factors.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is The Violence Project Database, a database that tracks incidents of mass shootings in the USA.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Before beginning analysis, The Violence Project Database will need to be cleaned and organized. This may involve removing duplicate entries, standardizing location data, and filling in missing information where possible.
Analysis will then involve a combination of descriptive statistics, data visualization, and potentially more complex statistical modeling techniques. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in the data, as well as to explore potential correlations with social and political factors such as gun laws, mental health policies, and demographic changes.
